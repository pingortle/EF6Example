# EF 6: Ignore the man behind the curtain.

This project comes from an attempt to ban references to Entity Framework in all assemblies except the ones that really need it, e.g. the persistence layer.

There should probably be some sort of instructions and documentation here, so I'll consider doing that sometime soon.
